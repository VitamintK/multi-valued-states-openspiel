# multi-valued-states-openspiel

Python code to do multi-valued states with [OpenSpiel](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel).

Multi-valued states is from ["Depth-Limited Solving for Imperfect-Information Games"](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=RLDbLcUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=RLDbLcUAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C) by Noam Brown, Tuomas Sandholm, Brandon Amos (2018) and was used (with multi-valued states for *both players*, which we refer to as "matrix-valued states" in the code in this repo) in superhuman NLHE agent Pluribus, described in ["Superhuman AI for multiplayer poker"](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=RLDbLcUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=RLDbLcUAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC) by Noam Brown, Tuomas Sandholm (2019).

This code is from my private repository with all of my game AI code. This code was part of a project with collaborators to do continuous resolving on a large game with collaborators, that we eventually tabled. I also used part of the code for Recon Blind Chess @Neurips 2021. I'm open-sourcing it now so anyone can look at it and use it.

I put the code up here without cleaning it up. It is definitely not "release-ready".
