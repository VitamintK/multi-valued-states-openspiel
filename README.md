# multi-valued-states-openspiel

Python code to do multi-valued states [ref 1](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=RLDbLcUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=RLDbLcUAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C), [ref 2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=RLDbLcUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=RLDbLcUAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC) with [OpenSpiel](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel).

This code is from my private repository with all of my game AI code. This code was part of a project with collaborators to do continuous resolving on a large game with collaborators, that we eventually tabled. I also used part of the code for Recon Blind Chess @Neurips 2021. I'm open-sourcing it now so anyone can look at it and use it.

I put the code up here without cleaning it up. It is definitely not "release-ready".
